    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely used technique for building recommendation systems. \n",
    "It relies on user interactions and relationships to predict preferences and suggest items. \n",
    "CF is applied in various domains, including:\n",
    "- **Streaming platforms**: Netflix uses CF to recommend movies and TV shows.\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Amazon suggests products based on user behavior.\n",
    "- **Music streaming**: Spotify personalizes playlists using user-item interactions.\n",
    "- **Social networks**: Facebook and Instagram recommend content based on user engagement.\n"
